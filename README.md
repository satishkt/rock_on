A little project to scrape and build text analytics based on lyrics for all my favorite bands.

The idea of the project is to gather lyrics for songs over the years and run some text analytics to see what comes out.  The initial and the painful part of the exercise is of course data gathering. The primary source of this data is (http://www.thelyricarchive.com/).

The Lyric Archive not only has lyrics for most of these bands, it also has lot of other useful metadata such as the genre of the band, genre of the album,the label, similar acts, founding years and active years and so on. It'd be super cool to see if some interesting insights emerge out of this information.

Anyways thats the plan.
